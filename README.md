# Overview of the analysis: 

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Results:

- In June we had a total count of 1700, mean of 74.95, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0

- In December we had a total count of 1517, mean of 71.04, min of 56.0 and max of 83.0

- Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 in December making a .5 difference in the two different seasons


# Summary:

The weather data for the months of June and December are closely similar with only a big difference around the min temperatures between the months of June and December. It would just show us it is colder in December that it is in June. 
For further investigation additional queries could have been run. The precipitation difference between the months of June and December to determine if one month has more rainy weather than the other. Additionally, the temperatures and precipitation should be taken year-round and just for two months. If we are able to predict which month year-round has the rainiest weather then it can show us when the shop should be closed and open year-round. Another import query to run would be wind speed because of the high winds in Hawaii may give us insight into the windy months the surf shop should be closed. Those are the two additional queries that I would recommend running.
